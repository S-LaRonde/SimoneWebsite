    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Founded by Simone La Ronde, in 2020, Manchester Cat and Kitten Rescue was created in response to the overwhelming amount of abandoned felines,
        who were adopted to be comfort during lockdown.
        However, after being taken in, in haste, their owners found that they could not care for them. </p>
